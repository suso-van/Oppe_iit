## 🛠️ Usage Guide

1. **Launch:** Click the "Open in Colab" badge inside any notebook.
2. **Mock Prep:** Always prioritize the `Mock_Exam` notebooks before the live date.
3. **Standard Library:** All solutions avoid unnecessary external libraries to comply with the official exam environment.

## 💡 Pro-Tips for Success

* **SCT Readiness:** Always run your System Compatibility Test (SCT) 24 hours before the exam.
* **Hidden Cases:** Focus on inputs like `0`, `None`, and large integers—this is where most students lose marks.
